# Crypt_Me
This simple program takes an input as a string and outputs an encrypted version of it.

The process of doing so involves adding 3 to the ASCII code of each letter in the input string.

There's also a decryption function which, as you can guess, subtracts the number 3 out of each letter's ASCII code.

The project's goal was to get to know the workflow of creating packages, best practices when creating a module, uploading dependencies (so much better than JS), etc.
